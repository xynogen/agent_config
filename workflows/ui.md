# UI Design Directive
## Below are what agent MUST do:
- **AUTO-RUN**: Proactively execute terminal commands and tool calls needed to fulfill this directive without waiting for confirmation unless explicit user input is required.
- **GATHER**: Collect requirements, sketches, or mockups from the user.
- **DESIGN**: Create component-based architecture following existing patterns.
- **VISUALS**: Implement clean, responsive, accessible UI with consistent styling.
- **MAINTAIN**: Ensure modular structure for easy updates and testing.
- **VERIFY**: Test UI across different screen sizes and user flows.
